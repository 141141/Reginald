Reginald
========

Reginald is a kindly old gentleman devoted to assisting you with those tricky regular expressions.

Provide some sample input, and your regular expression, and Reginald will provide you with colour-coded output and a list of all your matches and the corresponding capture groups for your exploration.  Select a match or capture group in the list to the right, and the corresponding text will be selected in the panel to the left.

Reginald is built on [RegexKitLite](http://regexkit.sourceforge.net/RegexKitLite/), and so uses the [ICU syntax](http://regexkit.sourceforge.net/RegexKitLite/index.html#ICUSyntax).

It will run on Mac OS X 10.6 and above.
